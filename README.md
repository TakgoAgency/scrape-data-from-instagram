##  FAQs

**Q:** How do you protect from scraping?  
**A:** This repo includes layered protections: request pacing with randomized backoff, user-agent and viewport variance, proxy rotation per job, and session reuse to lower anomaly spikes. It also supports selective field fetching (only what you need) to minimize request volume and exposure.

**Q:** Can screen scraping be detected?  
**A:** Yes. Platforms flag patterns like high-frequency requests, identical fingerprints, and repeated navigation flows. Mitigation includes human-like timings, realistic mouse/scroll events (in browser mode), diversified fingerprints, and strict concurrency caps.

**Q:** What data can you scrape from Instagram?  
**A:** Publicly available items such as profile metadata (bio, external URL, followers/following counts), public posts (captions, media URLs, like/comment counts, timestamps), comments (text, author, time), and hashtag/top-post summaries. Private or gated data is out of scope.
